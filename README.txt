Save money by moving power consumption.

The main purpose of this app is to limit the maximum power usage per hour so you don't breach your desired power tariff in Norway. Among other features, you may also use it as a price and situation-dependent heating controller or car charger controller.
Please contact the developer if you want support added for other countries.

Instructions:
- Install the app
- Go to Apps / Piggy Bank / Configure app
- Select devices that the app should control
- Set Mode to Normal
- Go to the "Normal" tab
  - Select target value for power tariff
  - Select device priorities
- Click save
- Save over 1000 NOK a year on the power tariff. (in Norway)
- Experiment with the settings and flows and follow the recommendations below to get the most out of the app.

Important:
- All devices controlled by the app should not be switched on by other flows, otherwise, conflicts will arise and the target value for the power tariff may fail.
- In case a flow informs the app about the current price point then the temperature should not be changed by other sources too.
- Other things such as brightness, max wattage, etc. can be controlled outside the app.

Recommendations:
- Use flows to change between normal / night mode at relevant times.
- Use flows to inform the app when the energy price is expensive/cheap.
- Configure the temperature settings for different modes and price points for optimal heating control.
- Use flows to turn off zones when a room is ventilated.
- Use flows to increase reserved power consumption at the start of the hour you normally cook dinner.
- Use flows to reduce reserved power consumption when you have normally finished making dinner.
- Use flows to ensure that you are notified when the app has detected a large uncontrollable power consumption before the end of the hour, which you must manually stop to meet the power tariff.
